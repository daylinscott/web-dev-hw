    <h1>Baked Orange Chicken and Brown Rice</h1>
      <blockquote>
        This high-protein, whole grain dish is easy to throw together.
        We love using chicken thighs because they're budget friendly
        and stay moist when cooking with the rice.
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
<li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
<li>2 cups of low sodium chicken broth</li>
<li>1 cup brown basmati rice</li>
<li>Zest and juice of two naval oranges</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>Four 6-oz <i>boneless, skinless,</i> chicken thighs</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of chopped, fresh mint</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of toasted pine nuts</li>
<ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to <b>375 degrees F.</b> Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until just beginning to brown and soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the onions, chicken broth, rice, 1/4 cup of the orange juice, 2 teaspoons of the orange zest, 1 tablespoon of oil and 3/4 teaspoon salt to a 2-quart baking dish and stir to combine.</li>
<li>Toss the chicken with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Nestle the chicken into the rice mixture. Cover the dish with foil and transfer it to the oven, being careful not to spill.</li>
<li>Bake for 55 minutes. Remove the foil and drizzle the chicken with 2 tablespoons of the orange juice. Continue to bake until most of the liquid has been absorbed, the chicken is fully cooked and the rice is tender, about 50 minutes more.</li>
<li>Drizzle the chicken with the remaining orange juice. Sprinkle the mint, pine nuts and desired amount of remaining orange zest over the dish and serve.</li>
