## What is a version control system?
Essentially, a version control system is a system that helps individuals and/or teams manage changes to source code over time. It records every modification made to the code over time within the software. This way, developers can look back on their code to see where they went wrong if a problem arises, which is precisely why we are using a version control system for this class.

## My Work Cycle
My work for this assignment was pretty straight forward, although I had some initial trouble pushing things to GitHub, I think I have it figured out now. It's cool to be learning how to use the Atom and GitHub software, while writing about them within the coding software. I am still having some trouble with linking my images and .txt document, but I'm posting on the group repo to hopefully gain some assistance with that.
