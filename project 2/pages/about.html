<h1> About </h1>
<p> I have lived in Missoula, Montana all of my life and started attending the University of Montana about three years ago. I have always been interested in photography and I have been shooting since I was in high school. I primarily shoot in film, which is something that I feel few people know about. I chose this "project" to provide the very basics on how to get started if you wish to become a film photographer. If you would like to learn more about film photography, there are many resources online. I have provided a link below to get you started. </p>
