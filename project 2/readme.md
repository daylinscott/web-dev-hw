## Learning html
Learning html over the course of this semester has been an entirely new experience for me. Although some of it has been, and continues to be difficult, it's rewarding to be able to understand how websites are created and even begin to create some of them myself.

## Decorating in html
I'm very excited to start this portion of the course, I feel as though this will be the part that I enjoy the most, as I am primarily in media arts for the arts.

## My Work Cycle
This is the first assignment that I actually had a lot of difficulties with, primarily with the aesthtic of my website. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong, but I couldnt get the font for the body of the home page to be any color other than black, and I was trying to put one of my film photos as the background, but having the font black made it too difficult to read. I also had some trouble with the navigation portion; I can navigate from home to "about" and to "contact" but I can't navigate anywhere else from there, I have looked at my code, and it looks correct, so I'm not quite sure what I'm doing wrong, but I will continue to work to understand and fix it.
