# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.
## Daylin Scott

I decided to take this class because I want to be able to share my art with the world in the most efficient way possible. I also want to become proficient in using technology, as I feel that is where we are headed in the future.

In the Q&A with the internet section I was surprised to learn:
* I learned that the web and the internet are actually two different things.
* I learned about the process of how we recieve our information, how we communicate with other computers through our server, and then through the actual internet, to another computer.
* I learned that 80 % of the web is actually the deep web.
